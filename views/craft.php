                        I have always dreamed of making beautiful objects.
                        Objects of striking design, that we love and keep.
                        Objects which have a story and which express certain values.
                        It’s the reason why I have created AKT in 2012 to transform war weapons into art objects and jewelry.

                        I collect the weapons through the Swiss Foundation for Mine Action, an NGO’s based in Geneva, in charge of disarming war zones.
                        These weapons are dismantled, transported, destroyed and then melted down until they disappear completely. We then recreate them as art objects.

                       Each object is created using artisanal methods, in order to produce highly creative items of excellent quality. The metal from the weapons is melted down in lab. It undergoes a treatment which renders it stainless and eliminates any risk of allergy. This preparation allows AKT to obtain a metal which strictly adheres to the European standards of the jewellery industry.
